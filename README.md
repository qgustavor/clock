# Clock

Just clock. A simple clock app for those who hate clock apps with ads. Because implementing a clock app is so dead simple a developer should shame themselves for adding ads to it.

Except that's not just a simple clock app:

- You can change fonts like a normal clock app, in fact, you can use any Google Font or locally available font.
- You can change colors like any normal clock app.
- But you can also enable screen burn-in protection which will slowly move the clock text around the screen.
- You can add countdowns to recurring events, useful if you use a clock app to track time in recurring manners.
- You can contribute to it adding more features.

I don't accept donations for this project. It's a fucking simple clock app, no developer should ever think "that's worthy of adding ads or asking for money".
